# Commission Example
 This is an example of one of the many video game commissions I've completed, along with example images of other work. It's an older project that had the simple goal of creating a high quality 3rd person character controller from scratch, that supports jumping, climbing, reversing direction, and more.
 
 ## Other Examples
 
 This is some other content displaying some of the other comissions I've worked on in the past. (For which I can not share the code)
